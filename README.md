#TODO:
Testing
Case Insensitivity 

# TO DOS
* Get a functioning version running without the Notion Calls 
* I really, really want to make this multithreaded
*  FIX LOGGER ISSUES 
* Disabled commands
    // Maybe give the CLI user a list of commands to enable and then dynamically pass in disabled ones
    // let disabled = vec![""].into_iter().map(|x| x.to_string()).collect();
    // this won't work but we're definitely onto something
* Something to make it so certain commands only work in certain channels
* Function to list commands
* All the TODOs in the code itself
